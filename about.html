            <h4 class="os-animation">WHO AM I?</h4>
            <p class="os-animation">I am really just a millenial with a keen interest in coding, design, animation, music, math and chess. I have built several projects based on these interests, most of which are listed on this page. I hope to utilise my skills someday to help progress humanity.</p>
            <h4 class="os-animation">MY STORY</h4>
            <p class="os-animation">I am a little kid of God who gets his satisfaction in life by trying to undertake actions that most others, rather than can, will not undertake. I realise I might not be a little kid later in the day, at a time when I will be old enough to be too lazy to bother updating this webpage, and hence I redefine kid here to mean a devotee, which I hope I remain throughout my life. Why not simply use devotee instead of redefining kid you ask? Well sir, to that I answer because this is the internet and you have the right to do almost anything you want. And that is called convenience, who even needs machines anymore?</p>
            <h4 class="os-animation">PRETTY AWKWARD GUY</h4>
            <p class="os-animation">Honesty check: I basically created this division so that the rule of three is followed. I love to employ unconventional methods to state a point at places where they really aren't called for, as it is how my itches of creativity satisfy their hunger.

            <h2>Selfcure.co</h2>
              <p>Founded <a href="http://selfcure.co/" target="_blank">Selfcure.co</a> which was my first website, after I learnt web coding from <a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codeacademy</a> and from <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/" target="_blank">Teamtreehouse</a>, back when it was free. The website intends to help people cure their addictions. I first presented the idea at a startup event <a href="http://selfcure.co/" target="_blank">in50hrs</a>, for which I had gotten a free ticket while purchasing my domain, where after optimistic responses I decided to continue working on this project. It was initially based on the path I undertook to stop my habit of gaming. It soon got boosted after my collaboration with the gaming addiction expert <a href="http://camerondare.com/" target="_blank">Cam Adair</a>. Apart from web coding, I learnt about email marketing, SEO, SMO(<a href="https://www.facebook.com/SelfCure.co/" target="_blank">Facebook page</a>), graphic design(for logo, social media and newsletters) and animation(built the explainer video), while working on this project.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-4 content-block margin-top"><span>02</span>
            <h2>Magneto Grouppe(magneto.in)</h2>
            <p>I have worked on a lot of projects at my dad's company, ranging from content creation, catalog, flyer, coupon, web design to video animation(in which you can even hear my silly voice overs, at a time when text to speech tools weren't that accurate, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/magnetoenvironmentalgrouppe/videos/554675151359990/" target="_blank">Hiring Help</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsijrz6-JHQ" target="_blank">IR Heater Intro</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsijrz6-JHQ" target="_blank">Air Pollution</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQHp83Z2FP4" target="extrenal">Misting Fan Series</a>), data management and excel sheet creation. My dad even allowed me to sit through two-three interviews and I even worked on some interview tests for the applicants. I even went for a 2-week business trip with my father to China in which we visited trade fairs and manufacturers in the cities of Ningbo, Gunangzhou, Beijing and Shanghai in April-May 2016. I also coded the webpage for <a href="http://mistfan.magneto.in/" target="_blank">eKool Misting Fan Series</a>.</p>

          <div class="col-md-4 content-block margin-top"><span>03</span>
            <h2>Animation</h2>
              <p>My learning curve for animation with After Effects was fairly intuitive: I just followed specific lessons such as exporting character rigs from photoshop to after effects, shape layer morphing and kinetic typography as per the requirement of my project. For my <a href="https://youtu.be/Z_jMPbMBMCE" target="_blank">first project</a> I drew myself on paper, traced that using a pen tool on photoshop and then after exporting to after effects, created a rig. Then I created some explainer videos(<a href="https://youtu.be/joP255JSCKY" target="_blank">Drair</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZOp0wqbFqtE" target="_blank">Selfcure</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/QeiqqKZ9Cjc" target="_blank">Wedding Timez</a> are some). I was even contacted by a company Makemyfoodie, which paid me 10k INR to build an <a href="https://youtu.be/Z_jMPbMBMCE" target="_blank">introduction video</a> for them, which was my first non-chess earning. I was even fascinated by 3d animation and decided to try out Autodesk Maya after knowing that a free 3 year student license was available. I built a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32auAUJzdSs" target="_blank">spacecraft traveling through a canyon</a> in space after following a <a href="https://www.udemy.com/introduction-to-3d-animation-with-autodesk-maya/" target="_blank">tutorial on Udemy</a>.

            <h2>Chess Achievements</h2>
              <p>I have been an avid chess player since I was 7 years old. Twice the CBSE North Zone Chess Tournament winner, twice a board prize awardee and once the runners up, U-9 Delhi State runners up and was sponsored for the nationals at Chennai by the DCA, three times the winner, once the runner up and twice the second runners up at Smt. Mohini Virendra Singh Chess Tournament, once the winner, once the runners up and once the second runners up at the Doon School Chess Tournament, and of course defeating my brother are some of my chess achievements.</p>

          <div class="col-md-4 content-block margin-top"><span>05</span>
            <h2>Doctor Air(drair.in)</h2>
              <p>I cofounded the startup <a href="http://drair.in/" target="_blank">Doctorair</a>, a service that empowers people by allowing them to view the quality of air they breathe, on both an on spot and a continuous monitoring basis. I coded some fragments of the home page and coded the directory <a href="http://drair.in/pm2.5/" target="_blank">drair.in/pm2.5/</a>, the earlier coming soon page, the intro video and built the outlook for <a href="http://aqm.drair.in/" target="_blank">aqm.drair.in/</a>. Along with coding, I built the brouchre for the aqm monitor, along with some flyers. I was even a part of a meeting with the <a href="https://igbc.in/igbc/" target="_blank">IGBC</a>, where I got to learn about the standards the air quality monitoring industry had.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-4 content-block margin-top"><span>06</span>
            <h2>Graphic Design</h2>
            <p>Just looking at cool pieces of art brought me happiness, and after realising that I didn't know how they were made built up to my agitation. Hence I learnt how to design using photoshop to build art myself. Nonetheless, it soon became a hobby and I started to build party invites for my friends too. I have designed several designs by now, including flyers, invites(for the event Modem at my school along with party invitations), social media posts and newsletter graphics. I even created a comic book for my brother on his 20th birthday. My biggest project was building a whole <a href="https://issuu.com/magnetogrouppe/docs/healthy_air" target="_blank">catalog for Magneto Grouppe</a> about the Healthy Air plan.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-4 content-block margin-top"><span>07</span>
            <h2>Web Design</h2>
              <p>This was the first coding skill that I had acquired. After learning how to code webpages online from Codeacademy and Teamtreehouse when I was in grade 8th, I started working on projects to gain practical knowledge. Apart from building selfcure.co and parts of drair.in, I coded <a href="http://modemmsvv.com/" target="_blank">modemmsvv.com</a>, <a href="http://drair.in/pm2.5/" target="_blank">drair.in/pm2.5</a>, <a href="http://mistfan.magneto.in/" target="_blank">mistfan.magneto.in</a>,  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.weddingtimez.com:80/" target="_blank">weddingtimez.com</a>(doesn't exist anymore) and this website of course.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-4 content-block margin-top"><span>08</span>
            <h2>Writing</h2>
            <p>I have always loved to pen down my thoughts, and the thing that really brings me alive is when my words are able to sway my audience in the way I want them to be swayed. By the same token, I have often acted as a content writer and editor, all in the hopes of receiving satisfaction by trying to make my audience connect to the information I provided them with. I am even in the process of writing a book, Reaching God. You can access the unfinished online pdf  <a href="" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-4 content-block margin-top"><span>09</span>
            <h2>Music</h2>
              <p>After reaching Rockschool grade 2 for guitar, and Trinity grade 3 for music theory, I decided to learning how to use Garageband and Audacity. My first composition was called Lost which I had made for my school assembly. My <a href="https://youtu.be/uafnmDXMSrc" target="_blank">main music project</a> was a sound track, called The Symphony, for which I built 10 versions(5 short and 5 long), all of which can be found on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/yatin_ag" target="_blank">Soundcloud</a>. While I might not be a great musician, I am really passionate about music nonetheless.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-4 content-block margin-top"><span>10</span>
            <h2>Hardware</h2>
            <p>When my brother gifted me a Particle Photon and an Arduino Uno, I couldn't help but create some basic projects. I built a motion detection based LED controller using the Arduino, and a <a href="hackster.io/yatinagarwal/light-detecting-email-sender-db18f4" target="_blank">light detecting email sender</a>, and a <a href="https://www.hackster.io/yatinagarwal/button-operated-email-sender-352edd" target="_blank">push button email sender</a> using the Particle Photon and IFTTT. I even create tutorials on <a href="https://www.hackster.io/yatinagarwal" target="_blank">Hackster</a> for my projects which received decent attention.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-4 content-block margin-top"><span>11</span>
            <h2>Public Speaking</h2>
            <p>Just like with writing, I love to sway people with words. I am decently confident for an introvert; being the key speaker at our school's stand at the India gate against air pollution, giving a speech on behalf of the whole chess team to the school and mostly being the narrator during house assemblies at my school are my main public speaking achievements.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-4 content-block margin-top"><span>12</span>
            <h2>Wedding Timez</h2>
            <p>I helped my mom set up her business which offered matchmaking services to unmarried people. I built a website for her company, along with some marketing material including graphic design(logo, social media posts and flyers), an <a href="https://youtu.be/QeiqqKZ9Cjc" target="_blank">intro video</a>, and a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/weddingtimez/" target="_blank">facebook page</a>. Though this service has now been discontinued.</a></p>
