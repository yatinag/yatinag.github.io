            <h3 class="sillyyeti" id="syheader">Great stars or I just am?</h3>
            <p class="sillyyeti" id="sypara">I wonder where my gratitude lies

These burdens of privileges make me seem ungrateful

Still I’m not not humble

Sometimes lost, other times unmotivated

Am I a medium of misplacing trust

I know what to deliver but 

Why do I sometimes prefer abstinence

I’d rather not get up

I tell myself it’s not procrastination but lack of reason

I have plenty, simply faith of my believers should suffice

My distant past seems bright,

Recent past worse than the present

Since I can write it down,

The inscribed tense must make the shape of this self-worth vs time function continuous

Why do I want to call it jet instead of aeroplane

Why do I want to call it Yah-tin instead of Yuh-tin

Why do I call it paasta now

This pretension weakens my cause

This writing seems creative, makes me prouder

I crave appreciation, am I complacent

I am complacent, self-appreciation is also appreciation

Some people are great, they make you feel new

I sometimes prefer being away from my family/people I like

It makes being close worth more

I trade things I have for things I used to or don’t

And then trade those things back

Do I more often gain more than lost

The gain will soon be traded for losses regardless

Is there a threshold to my number of trades

Will I settle down at some point

I guess new experiences help me gain more than lose

I feel empty after the great moments pass

Am I governed by balances or am I in control 

Will too much nectar not make it taste like water eventually

Are highest peaks always followed by lowest depressions

And if so, is it worth climbing the peak 

I wish I was allowed to wander down trails of infinity

I like to think I can decide whether I want to be governed by balances

I mean I have to forcefully assume this

Otherwise I could kill myself and it would be justified by balances and futility

An attempt at unlimited happiness is what motivates me to work

I don’t have a counterargument to futility 

Except this power of decision

Terming it a proof by contradiction doesn’t seem illogical

Regardless I’m trading feelings for feelings

Intelligence for community

Economic status for lifestyle

Wow a relatively easier opportunity than most to be healthy
              
That’s my privilege

So many can’t afford these trades

Then is that the goal?

Become a master trader?

Trade until you have everything worth not trading away anymore

Hit the threshold, reach satisfaction

I don’t know about role models I could follow

But for some reason, in my head a saint seems more satisfied than Bezos

I wish to be like my brother

Yet I wouldn’t trade my life for anyone’s

If only most immediate actions aligned

With great stars and intentions

Must owe great responsibilities

Or is all I owe to anyone to make sure I’m happy and grateful

Is it not oblivion to be only self-satisfied

Helping the less fortunate could be responsible

But is it abiding by society or

To society is happiness of some people more valuable

The post-greatness hollowness bothers me

Partly because the moment is over

Partly because it seems selfish to enjoy my privileges 

Sometimes selfishly following my inconsequential endless happy trails doesn’t seem moral

But sometimes are also shaped great cycles

Being self-satisfied translates to spreading smiles to less fortunate

Helping less fortunate contributes to self-satisfaction

“We have to work together as a race”

One in thirty-nine seemed really unlikely

I’m sure we’ve bested even greater odds

But it’s unfair to pick when I believe in luck

And when in fortune

Don’t remember having layered dreams before

Wouldn’t mind Shelton’s hair

Do making moves on those imaginary board games 

Allude to the non-uniformly random, hurried beats of my heart

Unbiased coin flips are my saved registers

Always dictating my morals somehow

Unaltered by environmental functions and my biases

I wonder if morals are closer to stars than to coincidences

This was supposed to be an objective overview, but let me have a little fun

Life will be more fun if I say stars

Oh I’m so fortunate

Mi amor our love was meant to be hehe

I love my brain so much

She can absolutely hate me 

But it’ll never believe that

One should never judge their actions by outcomes anyway

If I try my hardest, that’s all I can control

Of course, the hardest can be ambiguous

I hope I’ll know when to stop

Okay, let’s not get carried away and ruin our analysis with biased opinions

Should be patient said coin

I will have my chance

Why are my temptations tested so often

Precious gems must birth from strongest resistances

But isn’t my price frivolous if my target customer isn’t interested

Greatest marketeers sell products to non-audiences

Isn’t that a scam, even though the customer comes ‘voluntarily’

I don’t wish to scam anyone

I’d rather know if she isn’t interested in who I am

Not induce her feelings for whom I’m pretending to be

It’ll be more efficient to market elsewhere or not at all

But am I really anything if not pretension

I don’t carry a lot of intrinsic beliefs

My decisions are almost always event-specifc

I guess that is a form of belief of it’s own

I’m fine with getting closure, not fine, but better than now

The coin promises me my wishes

Not once has it not kept its agreement

Unsure if it’s my impatience or customer’s disrespect

The latter seems unlikely but I’m no mind reader

Be happy with what you get

And stop expecting more than you deserve

Knowing what you deserve is impossible but can recursively define it as what you get

You get what you deserve but also what you deserve is what you get

Do cool words hide my insecurities

I wish no deceit

But not knowing myself means I can’t promise accurate portrayals

Should people not advertise if uncertain about the product

My intrinsic inability to know is limiting

A higher species could be expected better from

These agents deem my morals ineffective

Nobody does consider morals universally true

Axioms can’t be subjective, which morals are

Truth doesn’t exist for certain cases

Replicating in a machine would be interesting

But settling for morals is only justified for cases with no truth

Someone might morally believe killing others is the way to salvation,

I really hope it’s true that killing others is a horrible deed

If I could execute my thoughts I’d be better

Being a better person is a good amount of what I thrive for

Checked the heart

Need to check the discipline

The more I explain myself

The more my thoughts become boring

Three hours were wasted thinking about nothing

I could vanish and nothing changes

Unsure if a depressing or an irrelevant statement

Apparently getting to top isn’t considered as hard as staying up there

Yet from ashes to flames makes a great story

But keeping the flame burning isn’t respected as much

Rather watch slumdog millionaire than 

A documentary - Donald trump doesn’t lose his dad’s money

This undervalues work in the latter scenario

Speaks of our ironic beliefs

Can’t distinguish genuine appeals from plots meant to sway

People state things they don’t believe in

To support temporary arguments 

It’s unfair to pick and choose opposites attract

Or you make me complete

With we don’t have a lot in common

When they use the same arguments to support opposite things

Sometimes we don’t build arguments on logic

We modify our logic to satisfy our arguments

Our personal biases govern such reason

Our self-affirmation makes us justify our decisions instead of making justified decisions

It makes us happier but hollower, weird tradeoff

This can be misused by an agency if they know how to alter your biases

My and my customer’s heads engage in this too

We call it upon the stars to leave weird trails for us

Orange monkeys were four times three

Genesis of Earth was four plus three

Four negative three makes us one

Coincidences surprise us and we demand reason

I would have said it was meant to be

I did so during previous pitches in fact

But now I understand my biases

If this was an argument to prove predestination 

The insignificances of f(four, three) for infinitely many f(x)

And that of genesis and monkeys with respect to some of these functions

Make for infinitely many logical counters

Regardless I love these numbers

Helps cloud our judgements

I don’t mind the false reaffirmation for decisions that feel great 
Because one misconception that proves a decision is great isn’t logical

Doesn’t mean the decision can’t be great

I seem happier and it’s all that matters

What are the chances?

With a meandering heart, as high as you want them to be

FUCKFUCKFUCK I let down the coin

Alas my customer made sure I wasn’t delusional

Atleast I’m not disrespected

About as unaffected as I’m sad

Impatient and immature, I did call it upon myself

Consequently the coin called off its promises

Everything is so predictable

I mostly know the consequences of my actions

Although sometimes helps me be righteous, I’m bored

Can I not be surprised?

Can nothing come out of nowhere 

Grab my balls, make me squeal, leave me in wonder

Maybe the decisions I make are too easy

Imagine instead of deciding when to study when

Having to deal with a murder

Not knowing the consequences

It’s horrible how I can relate to such actions

And sympathize with the murderer

I want to join a fight club

I don’t think I can predict how many punches come my way

I feel too austere, I wonder what my blood tastes like

I don’t feel hatred or spite 

But I want to punch someone’s face in and get my own scarred while we both smile

My logic is skewed, how am I ready to let down my great stars

Only because I’m bored?

These biases are so influential

Earlier satisfied with coin flips dictating morals,

And now I find knowing morals boring

I either need to make up my mind or

I think too much, sometimes I do feel satisfied in moments

Should live for those

Just feel really hollow right now

Would I wish for a numb brain if I could?

I wanted to be a bird when I was younger

Evolution is real, but what purpose does it serve?

What the fuck is that question?

What purpose does anything serve?

I think two options

Someone really gracious turns around predictable toggles

While I sit here, really thankful but not very entertained

I serve as a test subject for hopefully meaningful research

Or I just am

Don’t know if I’d prefer either

I could make better decisions if I knew though

If I just am, I’ll be careless do what I want

If I’m part of some research I’ll live more by the truth and my morals

Not be in a superposition between the two

It’d be so cool to have a clone

We’ll both live by each purpose

I’m sure out of billions, many live on both extremes

I’d just like information about the correct one

Onwards I go with unrealized individual worth metrics

Can try to understand the reasons for life origins

By relating it to that of things we build

All such things are created to serve a form or/and function

They’re either given shape just for the hell of it/by accident

Or/and designed to serve a certain function

Consider the invention of written language

Could have been introduced to

Allow communicating ideas more effectively than hand expressions

Or/and someone really bored of drawing wall engravings

Decided to list some symbols and assign them

Everyday objects and feelings

All for the sake of it

As unlikely as the exclusive latter seems,

It is also hard to imagine a whole language system

Created by an individual to be more efficient for him

Than communicating that thought with some finger pointing

And if the function came first

It still has to take the form of language

For my sanity, I’d like to assume everything around me is as real/unreal as me

I really hope my life isn’t just a series of events someone is dreaming away

Only the co-existence of function and form seems plausible

Similarly we struggle to imagine if we were created to serve a pre-destined function

Or we just exist to live by our intentional/impulsive decisions

Drawing parallel to reasoning behind our creations indicates a mixture

Maybe then our superposition is justified 

There is no correct amount of planning

My current combination of spontaneity

With some amount of analyzing isn’t too shabby

There is no correct way of living my life

But there could be so many more layers to existence than form and function

Dealing with abstract feelings/concepts like soul, love that seem to add meaning 

And heavily relying on my morals to dictate my function,

Well knowing about the limitations of my shifty morals,

They all often make me doubt the intentions/rightfulness of my actions

I guess I shouldn’t bother about things that I can’t control

I just hoped I could control myself more 

I shouldn’t complain, it’s good to have unachievable goals

It was all five minutes of thrill - getting into a decent university, declaring major, landing jobs

I could predict more dreams that will be a few minutes of thrill -

Owning my exotic animal farm, getting rich, getting the girl I like

It’s not very satisfying to keep having to ask what’s next

Controlling my emotions, finding my function, becoming a perfect man 

They seem like great journeys that I’ll never achieve, 

But pursuing which will make me animate almost throughout my life

Lacan, I might feel self-alienated every time I look in the mirror, 

Hating myself for the person I wish to be but am not

and loving myself for trying to be that person

But these thoughts makes me feel alive, and I am really thankful for it

Just always be nice Yatin, and very very stupid.
