            <p>The rapid influx of apparent knowledge and groundbreaking discoveries have inevitably led to our race becoming smarter. As an aspiring computer science major, I explore the consequences of technology singularity on human lives in this blog. It is important to speculate a world where robotic humanoids co-exist with us and what it could mean to recognise their existence as an independant species. I explore these consequences using ideas of futurist authors to explore the game - "Detroit: Become Human".</p>

            <h4>DETROIT: BECOME HUMAN</h4><img src="assets/images/blog/androids.gif" alt="Android"/>
            <p>The game is about how androids (robotic humanoids) created by humans interact with the human world. Although they were built to make human lives simpler by following the instructions of their masters, the development of consciences in these androids complicates their purpose. Androids that develop an understanding of their identity through these induced feelings are termed deviants and act as a central theme in the storyline. They transition from a phase of being commanded by humans, to liberating themselves by recognizing themselves as independent beings. The game presents two major path options for androids, either fighting against the humans to become the only species in power or protesting for equal rights until they're recognized by the humans and given equal rights.</p>

                    <p>Androids were meant to be companions for mankind, help children with their homeworks, police with investigations, take care of homes and perform any function possible to be performed by machines on behalf of humans. The effects of such functions are explored by Latour when he describes how non-humans, technology, and inanimate objects mediate our lives. His idea of how we aren't the most important species and that all the aforementioned objects are equally important is most directly reflected in the storyline of the game when the androids develop an understanding of their identity. They question the humans about why they should serve them and not instead behave as free beings. We can understand Latour's illustration of an inanimate door closer's role to further understand the importance of these objects. When posed with the challenge of going through a wall without breaking it and generalising that process for every instance of such a move, Latour suggests two alternatives, "[D]iscipline the people or ... substitute for the unreliable people another delegated human character whose only function is to open and close the door. ... The advantage is that you now have to discipline only one human and may safely leave the others to their erratic behaviour" (Latour 300). According to Latour, a  An unprecedented consequence of delegating a non-human to such a task is explored in the game when the deviants Such a proposal convolutes Asimov's laws of robotics: "A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. The robot must also protect its own existence as long as the protection does not conflict with the first two laws."
