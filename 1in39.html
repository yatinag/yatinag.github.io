            <h3 class="sillyyeti" id="syheader">Some Great Stars Have Aligned</h3>
            <p class="sillyyeti" id="sypara">I wonder where my gratitude lies

These burdens of privileges make me seem ungrateful

Still I’m not not humble

Sometimes lost, other times unmotivated

Am I a medium of misplacing trust

I know what to deliver but 

Why do I sometimes prefer abstinence

I’d rather not get up

I tell myself it’s not procrastination but lack of reason

I have plenty, simply faith of my believers should suffice

My distant past seems bright,

Recent past worse than the present

I wonder if this function has been continuous

Why do I want to call it jet instead of aeroplane

Why do I want to call it Yah-tin instead of Yuh-tin

Why do I call it paasta now

This pretension weakens my cause

This writing seems creative, makes me prouder

I crave appreciation, am I complacent

I am complacent, self-appreciation is also appreciation

Some people are great, they make you feel new

I prefer being away from family, brings us closer

I trade things I have for things I used to or don’t

And then trade those things for what I do

Do I gain more than lost 

The gain will soon be traded for losses regardless

Is there a threshold to my number of trades

Will I settle down at some point

I guess new experiences help me gain more than lose

I feel empty after the moments pass

Am I governed by balances or am I in control 

Am I allowed to wander 

Will too much of nectar not make it taste like water eventually

Are highest peaks always followed by lowest depressions

I like to think I can decide

Although uncontrollable happiness would deem passion, goals futile 

I don’t have a counterargument to futility 

Except this power of decision

A supposed contradiction which may not be illogical

Regardless I’m trading traits for feelings

Intelligence for community

Economic status for lifestyle

Wow that’s my privilege

So many can’t afford fresh feelings

Then is that the goal?

Trade until you can’t gain anymore

Hit the threshold, reach satisfaction

If only most immediate actions aligned

with great stars and intentions

Must owe great responsibilities

Or all I owe to anyone is to make sure I’m happy and grateful

Is it not oblivion to be only self-satisfied

Helping the less fortunate could be responsible

But is it abiding by society or 

To society is happiness of some people more valuable

I don’t feel really nice after greatest moments

Partly because they’re over, partly because it would be selfish

Again do inconsequential endless happy trails exist

Sometimes are shaped great cycles

Being self-satisfied translates to spreading smiles to less fortunate

Helping less fortunate contributes to self-satisfaction

“We have to work together as a race”

1 in 39 seemed really unlikely 

Can’t pick when I believe in luck

And when in fortune

Don’t remember having layered dreams before

Wouldn’t mind Shelton’s hair

Do making moves on those imaginary board games 

Allude to the hurried beats of my misled heart

Unbiased coin flips are my saved registers

Always dictating my morals somehow

Unaltered by environmental functions

Are morals closer to coincidences or to stars

Shittiest reason ever, but coincidentally we talk of stars here

I will say stars, I’m so fortunate

Should be patient said coin

I will have my chance

Why are my temptations tested so often

Precious gems must born from strongest resistances

But isn’t my price frivolous if my target customer isn’t interested

Greatest marketeers sell products to non-audiences

Isn’t that a scam, even thought the customer comes in voluntarily

I don’t wish to scam anyone

I’d rather know if he isn’t interested

It’ll be more efficient to market elsewhere or not at all

I’m fine with getting closure, not fine, but better than now

The coin promises me my wishes

It has always stood up 

Unsure if it’s my impatience or customer’s disrespect

The latter seems unlikely but I’m no mind reader

Be happy with what you get 

And stop expecting more than you deserve

Do cool words hide my insecurities 

I wish no deceit

But not knowing myself means I can’t portray correctly

Should people not advertise if uncertain about the product

My instrinsic inability to know is limiting

A higher species could be expected better from

Morals deemed ineffective for these agents

Nobody does consider morals universally true

Axioms can’t be subjective

Truth doesn’t exist for certain cases

Replicating in machine would be interesting

Settling for morals isn’t immoral

If I could execute my thoughts I’d be better

Being a better person is all I thrive for

Checked the heart

Need to check the discipline

Locked section - come back later

The more I explain myself

The more my thoughts become boring

Last 3 hours were wasted thinking about nothing

I could vanish and nothing changes

Unsure if depressing or irrelevant</p>
